# The Right to The City  

## Intro  
 - Though we advocate for social change we do not challange market logic  
 - The city is made by man but is it in their best interest?  
   - Are they condemed to live there?  
 - We have a fundamental right to change the city to meet our needs  
 - Capatilism in the buisness of selling surplus  
 - If profit is not acceptable, tech needs to replace workforce  
   - Or they need to be disciplined  
 - Urbanization has played a role in the absorbing surplus product of capatilists  

## Urban Revolutions  
 - Recall the ascension of Napoleon and the restructuring of urban space  
 - Reconstruction of Paris absorbed large amounts of labor and capital  
 - Ushured in the ideas of debt financed urban improvements  
 - Reconstruction changed both the city and the culture  
   - Increased tourism and spending  
 - Read up on the Paris Commune  
 - Similar restructuring process of urban space in NYC in 1940's post war  
   - Read as the suburbanization process  
 - This process created a period of soical stability  
   - The focus of middle class was shifted to protect home owner values  
   - Defense of property values and individualized identities  
   - Note that this process was also systematically biased  
 - Surburban living created discontent even amongst those living there  

## The Urban Struggle  
 - Urbanization is centrl to the survival of capatilism  
 - To large and larger degress urban spaces are dictating rural lifestyle  
 - First bubble came with the housing market collapse  

## Girding the Globe  
 - US urban expansion steadied the global economy buy borrowing to pay for wars and expansion  
 - Global urban expansion occuring as well like in China  
 - Expansion of urban space has picked up conspicous wealth in areas like Dubai  
 - Hosuing costs in urban areas becoming unsustainable  
 - Author argues that a global financial crisis is likely looming  

## Property and Pacification  
 - Quality and city itself in urban space has been commodified  
 - Pacification by cappucino  
 - This state makes defense of property, in terms of economic worth, tantamount  
   - Setup is inherently conflict prone  
 - Cities are facilitating seperation by way of  
   - Private public spaces  
   - Gated communities  

## Dispossessions  
 - Most city transormations require destruction of space  
   - This space is most often populated by the poor  
 - This phenomenon is reoccuring  
 - See accumulation by dispossesion  
 - Any place that does not have an official deed is up for grabs  
 - Any displaced individual is often not within rights to demand compensation  
 - Author gives examples of scenarios in India and China  
 - Offering ownership to individuals often has them resettling anyway at low prices  
 - Author hedges bets on favelas transorming into scenic urban dwellings  
   - As the original inhabitants get displaced  

## Formulating demands  
 - At some point populations push back and demand justice  
 - Examples of social movements presented by author  
 - Simple solution is greater democratic control over the surplus  
 - OECD data shows that the states portion of gross output has been constant  
   - Since the 1970s  
 - Increasing the states share only has beneficial effect if is democratically owned  
 - Those with agency are ablet to reshape the urban fabric to their needs  
   - New Haven and Yale  
   - Bloomberg in NYC  
 - Financial crises rarely affect the affluent in terms of possesion or income  
 - Urban movements are pushing against this and asking for bail out funds to be reappropriated  
    - Who needs to be bailed out here?  
    - These movements lack the size in order to get demands met  
    - They also dont have a way of seizing the surplus  
 - Unifying struggles needs to hinge on the right to the city
