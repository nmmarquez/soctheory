Week 6: Neo-Marxism

In Manza’s recap of the rise, fall, and legacy of neo-Marxism, he outlines issues that were still extremely relevant to contemporary Marxist writings. While, Manza sees other critical theories such ace critical race and feminist theories as a replacement for Marxist theory, it really seems like they are an application of Marxism and conflict theory. Manza recognizes to some degree but I do not see the utility in making a distinction as Marxism as separate from race and feminist theories. Regardless, Manza makes valid points about leftist ideologies making concessions such as finding more equitable solutions within the current current capitalist framework. Harvey expands on this in ‘The Right to the City’ when he describes recent social movements advocating for social change but not addressing the market logic that he feels has inherently created this divide. 

In Harvey’s article he describes the history of urbanization as a tool for the capitalist market to unload the surplus it creates by offering a buying market. This is at odds with what he sees as the main point of modernization, which is to improve the state of being of individuals. This approach is very different from other Marxist approaches that see most forms of modernization as an attack on more egalitarian lifestyles. Harvey sees the urban space as a potential breeding ground for social movement and demands that the urban centers be focused on moving industry to the control of democratically elected governments that will benefit the urban population at large rather than a few businesses and/or influential government officials. Furthermore, Harvey argues that the current structure of urban sprawl is designed in such a way that those with power are in a position to almost exclusively bend the urban fabric to their need. The question then is why Harvey and others believe that it is possible for urban citizens to take control of the situation and have more authority over their environment.

Harvey and Burawoy here point to the numerous social movements that  have occurred in opposition to neoliberalism, austerity  measures, and globalization by the west in the past 15 years as proof of the ability of citizens to organize and resist as long as they have sufficient rights to organize in a public space. Though few, if any, of these social movements have manifested themselves in the way that neo-Marxists in this week's readings have envisioned, demanding of urban production be a right to the citizens, citizens of several countries have been able to take back ownership of industries such that there surplus will directly benefit their citizens. Burawoy also points at current liberal socially minded leaders such as Thomas Piketty and Pope Francis as being able to organize, in a more mainstream fashion, and advocate against the social ills of the current form of capitalism. While these leaders may spark ideas of alternative forms of governmental organization, however, it is ultimately up to citizens to demand these rights from their governments.
