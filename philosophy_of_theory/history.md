# Brief History of Sociology  

Study up on 
 - the transition from feudelism to capatilism  
 - agency theory  
 - institutional economics vs behavioral economics  

## Marx, Weber, Durkheim  

Marx  
 - Materilist: All ideas and culture come from the material world  
 - What is primary in the material word is the economy  
   - The economy determines the political world  
   - the culture  
   - etc  
 - Focus on the mode of production of economy as opposed to the market  
   - unlike smith  
 - history of organization has moved from  
   - primitive communism  
   - fill  
   - in  
   - the  
   - blanks  
 - those who dont own the means of production must work for those who do  
   - this is inherintly exploitive says marx  
 - all societies go through the same development cycle  
 - Macro level theory  

Durkheim  
 - defined the field seperate from biology, psychology
 - social constructionist (the isntitutions)  
   - people are shaped by the societies and the cultures by which they grow  
 - endoginized the theory of cpatalism  
 - cemented sociology via a rhetoric on suicide  
   - argues that sociology can answer the question apart from bio and psych  
   - suicide is higher in unmarried groups  
   - higher in protestants than catholics (group solidarity)  
   - higher in the military (altruistic suicide)  

Weber  
 - Sociology should not be based in natural sciences  
   - What it is you study should dictate how you study it  
   - the object of study is people  
   - You need to get into the head of the object of study  
     - Sympathetic Understanding  
   - cultural ethnography is a must in order to understand motivation  
 - four fields of individual choice  
   - rationality, values, habit, and emotion  
 - check out ideal time  
 - wasnt top down alternated on importance from micro to macro

Mead and Gothman  
 - Symbolic Interaction  
 - relationships from entities more important than the individuals  
 - the interaction itself must be studied  
 - Think of the looking glass self  
   - We define ourselves based on how others perceive us  
 - We also define ourselves by reinforcing it with others (gothman)  

## Philosophy of Science  
 - Positivism  
   - Theories as propositions  
   - **if a, then b**  
   - but we need a scope  
   - **for all x**  
 - Realism  
   - But how does A lead to B  
   - We need a narrative or causal mechanism  
   - Models help place complex things together  
     - As well as how things are interconnected  
 - Conventionilist (Post Modern)  
   - Interpretive approach  
   - Generalizations could be impossible because of sympathetic understanding  
   - The world is to complex and you can only build narritives of what happened
