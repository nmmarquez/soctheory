# Economic Performance Through Time  

## Economic History  
 - Concerned with the development of the economies over time  
 - Economics is largely concerned with actions in the current state of the market  
 - Vital to economic development studies  

## Institutions and the Economy  
 - Markets are rarely efficient and transactions are costly  
 - Players learn correct methods by trial which is costly   
 - Institutions are not independent of the economic market
   - This is unlike what economists act in analysis  

## Institutions and Organizations  
 - Interactions between institutions and organization shape the economy  
 - Recall organizations are bounded by some common interest  \
 - Organizations that surface do so by support of the Institutional Framework  
 - Change comes about by alteration in strategies by individuals of organizations  
 - Recall though that the greater the monopoly the less incentive to learn  

## Rationality and the Nature of Human Learning  
 - Rational choices are less certain in uncertain markets  
   - Like what is even rational then?  
 - Mental models are constructed from experience and then reshaped with new ones  
 - Mental models are appropriated for new situations unlike other animals or AI  
 - Common culture reduces divergence in exploration  
 - Institutions order the environment, Mental models tell us what the env is  

## Institutions and Economic Growth  
 - Cultural continuity through customs, taboo and myths  
 - More complex societies mean more institutions  
 - Why has there been slow economic learning?  
 - why has this learning not been spread?
   - Maybe economic models of growth isn't the best way to approach this question  

## The Institutional Approach and Inequity  
 - Nothing is automatic about the evolution of an economy  
 - Path dependence in growth or stagnation (relatively speaking)  
 - This model blends together demography, technology, and institutions  
   - namely in how they all effect the path of the market  

## Implications  
 - Rules change slowly due to perceived norms  
 - This affects institutions and thus the market  
 - Recall norms provide legitimacy to decision making  
 - One economy can not simply adopt the rules of another and expect similar performance  
 - Studies of evolving economies largely focus on US  
 - Institutions need to be backed by organizations to persist  
 - Institutions and belief systems must change in order to have successful reform (meh)  
 - Developing new norms is hard without reinforcement  
   - Not a simple matter of cost effective  
 - Long term economic growth needs rule of law  
 - Adaptive efficiency is key!
