# Toward a Renaissance of Rational Choice  

## Introduction  
 - Some postulate that there are core differences between economic actors and social ones  
 - Though models have been complicated their core component of maximizing payoffs hold  
 - Economic theory has recently expanded to include Bayesian Game theory  
 - Current theory is insufficient for use in sociology and needs to include  
   1. Psycho Social theory of norms  
   1. Replacement of Nash equilibrium with correlated equilibrium  
   3. Social norms are objective correlating devices  
   4. Internalizing of social norms should be included on the preference ordering  

## Game Theory to Social Theory  
 - Actors rarely perform at Nash equilibrium  
 - At minimum individual actions need to include the social norm  
 - We can infer actions from others as long as we adhere to social norms  
 - Social norms aren't just coordinating devices but also motivating one  

## Rationality does not Imply Backwards Deduction  
 - Backward induction in the absence of common knowledge rational is non advantageous  

## Social Norms and Rational Action  
 - Mixed strategies of Nash or a no go  
 - Our best strategy is to obey some choreographer if all others are likely to  
 - Common prior assumption of individual actor is grounded in common culture assumptions  
 - Theories of human behavior must include ideas of ethics and norms  

## Preferences are a Function of Context  
 - People make evaluation on whether the group holds the same ethics and norms  
 - See the outcome of the Dictator Game
