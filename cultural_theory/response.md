Week 4: Cultural Theories  

DiMaggio and Powell argue that bureaucracies have become more homogenous in any particular domain that we choose to observe thema and even though new fields develop, the rate at which they become homogeneous is a function of the process that lead to either mimetic, coercive, or normative isomorphism. Though isomorphism is rampant, the others argue, its rate of emergence in new fields should be testable and in Meyer’s article on the World Society we find ourselves an example of how actors on the world platform may have been forced to act similarly.

Meyer lays out the current state of study of New Institutionalism as being approached anywhere on the spectrum of Realist to the Phenomenological approach where the two camps differ most greatly on the belief of endogeneity of the the institution on the actor. While both models are not at odds with each other in terms of methodology, their approach gets at differential actions of actors within institutions and the Phenomenological approach argues that actors actions are indeed shaped by their institutions which offer a contemporary source of a meaning system. Meyer is clearly in line with a much more Phenomenological approach as he shows how legitimacy is derived by actors from their participation in institutions and focus primarily on social movement organizations and institutions relating to education. 

A point of contention that I saw with Meyer’s explanation of how this led to a more fair and collaborative set of institutions that, although they stem from "cut-throat capitalism" and "murderous histories" were now compelled to act in much more cooperative manner because of the need to at least appear as a virtuous Other.  While this model may explain some level of motivation behind why non-governmental agencies partake in acts of seemingly social good, it seems like this is a poor model to explain how some institutions choose to continuously exploit the current global market and make decisions that although appear superficially beneficial, may actually be detrimental to the entities who choose to do business with these Others. A recent notable example of this that I can recall is the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority Bondholder group offering a loan to a hurricane stricken territory of the US in desperate need of funds to mobilize and evacuate citizens. A loan that would ultimately prioritize repayment for their firm from Puerto Rico and leave PR with more accumulated interest.

This is not to say that I do not think that there are Institutions that reflect the nature that Meyer describes in his article. It would seem impossible to argue that there isn't a new set of moral standards by which multilateral organizations are evaluated and are able to be legitimate actors who in turn give legitimacy to their students. I do think, however, that the fact that by in large these organizations stem from western ideals and then western society elites continue to benefit most from global business, as evidence by growing national level disparities, is telling of the nature of the system and the limitation of influence of the virtuous Other.
