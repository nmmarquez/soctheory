# What is Field Theory?  

## Characteristics of Field Theory  
 - It is distinct and offers new insight  
 - It purports to explain changes in the states of some elements but need not appeal to changes in states of other elements  
 - These changes in state involve an interaction between the field and the existing states of the elements  
 - The elements have particular attributes that make them susceptible to the field effect  
 - The field without the elements is only a potential for the creation of force, without any existent force  
 - The field itself is organized and differential  

## The points applied  
 - Things have a force of motion even when nothing else is changing  
   - Such as a careers inherent upward mobility force  
 - Not all agents need be affected by a field in order to exist  
   - That bheing said we must specy a priori which actors are susceptable  
 - X chnages Y via changes in the field not direct action  

## Faults of field theory  
 - Tautology and circular reasoning  
 - Lack concrete forces such as a mechanism  
 - Lack of concrete explanation  

## Varieties of Field Theory  
 - Consider that although we have receptors how w einterprewt stimuli is affective 
 - Movement as a change in the field not physocal space  
 - Individuals aware of changes
