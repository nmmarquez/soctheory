# World Society, Institutional Theories, and the Actor  

## Introduction  
 - Sociological theory currently dominated by theories revolving around agents  
 - Contrast this with early Soc theory focused on societies built by families and communities  
 - Individuals have moved to the place of agents  
   - Agents are capable of advocating for themselves and have dome form of bargaining power  
   - this is in contrast, perhaps, with pre-enlightment man who had little power  
 - Now the question arises on how actors are the governed  
   - This has led to the ris of new found interest in defining institutions  
 - The new institutionalism is a conflict between agency and structure  
   - Again contrast this with old institutions of endogenous ideas of culture  
   - We are a part of culture but have little power to envoke change in it  
     - Culture is cunstructed outside the individual  

## The New Institutionalisms  
 - Two sides of the spectrum  

| Point  | Realist                      | Phenomenological              |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|  1     | Actors ind. of institutions  | Actors leitimated by instit   |
|  2     | Instit have very few rules   | Complex cultural meaning      |
|  3     | Organizationally binding rule| Institution as meaning system |

 - On the Phem side institutions can cause there actors to simply comply to requirements  
 - In Phem models actors are scripted by their intitutions
   - Cganges to the script then become a unique case of study  

## The Red Line  
 - In analysis both of these traditions can be considered  
 - The conflict arises simply because of institutinalized normative considerations  
 - What is the motoivation for the system  
   - Can it really be said to stem from an agents desire or rather normative reasoning  

## contsructing a Stateless World Polity  
 - Corporate nationalism created some real global tension  
 - Increased interdependence led to creation of a semi-supranational state  
   - Albeit a weak one in the form of UN and EU  
 - In conjuction with this we have the rise of social movement organizations  
   - They represent collective universal goods  
 - In addition there is a growth of professional Others  
    - Those whose job dont involve action but rather better others  
    - think consultants, teachers, lawyers, etc.  
 - If society is to change we need to ensure that agents have sufficient power  
 - How do we do this while also quelling competing desires of actors  

## Rationalization: The Scientized Environment Supporting Actorhood  
 - The domain of Science has increased remarkably  
 - Able to answer origin questions as well as questions of everyday life  
 - Science now used as a means of social control even when not well defined  
   - New form of legitamacy  

## Ontology: Constructing the Person as Primordial Actor  
 - Global scene lead to an increase of human rights  
 - Increase of internataional treaties aimed at human rights  

## The Modern Social Order  
 - The development of the modern society is one in developing agency  
 - The rise in education is one way of enacting this agency  
   - A consequence is that globally socializes individuals to modern gloabl culture  
   - The thus become legitimately empowered actors  

## Core Themes of Institutional Theory  

### Others and the Construction of the Expanded Modern Actor  
 - How do models of legitimacy form?  
 - How do actors improve there state?
 - take for example traditionally marginalized groups?  
   - Did this in control willing give them agency?  
   - Did they take it for themself?  
   - Where they enabled by squadrans of Others with universal principles?  

### Persons and Groups Adopt Expanded Models of Actorhood  
 - Groups that offer legitamizing power enable more widespread agency to happen  

### Decoupling: The Relation between Actor Identity and Practice  
 - Motives can be underlying and not reflect policy
