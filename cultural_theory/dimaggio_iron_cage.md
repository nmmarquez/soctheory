# The Iron Cage Revisted  

## Introduction  
 - Bureaucratization efficent enough to enslave mankind  
 - Weber argues that bureacracy stems from  
   - Competition among capatilist firms  
   - Competition among states  
   - Bourgeois demand for equal protection  
 - DM argues that the cause of bureaucratization has changed  

## Organizational Theory and Diversity  
 - Most tools look at variation among subjects  
 - We observe that there is striking homogeneity  
 - As a field becomes established we see more similarity among actors  
 - Powerful forces push organizations in the same field to act similarly  
 - Isomorphism best characterizes this process  

### Three Mechanisms of Isomorphic Institutional Change  
 - Coercive isomorphism that stems from political influence and legitamacy  
   - Regulations require certain positions are structures to be maintained  
   - Legitmacy desires require organizational homogeneity  
 - Mimetic isomorphism resulting from standard respsonses to uncertainty  
   - Mimic srtategies are used to emulate success  
   - Also used for legitimacy  
 - Normative isomorphism resulting from professionalization  
   - Organizations compete to offer similar services to be legitamized
