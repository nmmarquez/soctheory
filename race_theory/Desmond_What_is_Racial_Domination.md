# What is Racial Domination?  

## Introduction  
 - Article inteded to be the framework of critical race theory and race domination  
 - Provide a clear definition of racial domination and what it is not  

## What is Race?  
 - A symbolic category based on phenotype or ancestry, misrecognized as a natural category  

### Symbolic Category  
 - Symbolic is created by humans rather than being pregiven and only nedding labeling  
 - Many academics, still, argue that racial conflict is a product of c lass conflict  

### Phenotype or Ancestry  
 - In the US both play a strong role in defining race however this is not always the case  
 - Stereotypyes and stigmas lead to individuals resisting classification into marginalized groups  
 - Louisiana is backwards as fuck till 1983 and used the 1/32 rule to assign race to black  

### Social and Historical Contexts  
 - Race is extremely different depending on historical and social context  
 - Racial domination persists by erasing its past and invrnting itself new  
   - It needs to because race is temporally contextual  

### Misrecognized as Natural  
 - Something created by humans is mistaken as natural and given   
 - Why are any of the things we choose to divide by for race the the signifier we choose?  

## Ethnicity and Nationality  
 - Ethnicity refers to a shared lifestyle informed by cultural, historical, religious or national affliliation  
 - Ehnicity is equally socially constructed  
 - "You are not black cause you are black, you are black because of how you act"  
 - Whites have more ethnic, or just social, fluidity  
 - Race and ethnicity are decoupled for whites but bound tightly for non-whites  
 - Up until 1924 with the Johnson-Read act Immigration was highly encouraged in the US  
   - Ignoring the Chinese exclusion act  
 - New laws didnt applt to "national origin" countries of europe, ie white countries  
 - White people were understood to be upstanding, law-abiding, moral, and intelligent. Conversely, non-White people, from whom citizenship was withheld, were thought to be base, criminal, untrustworthy, and of lesser intelligence  

## Five Fallacies about Racism  
 - Racism is much broader than violence and epithets  

### Individual Fallacy  
 - Racism is an individual act  
 - An individual is either racist or not and can be counted as such  
 - This is conflating racism with prejudice  
 - Labeling someone as racists shift our focus from the social  
 - Racism is often habitual, unintentional, commonplace, polite, implicit, and well meaning  

### Legalistic Fallacy  
 - Abolishing racist laws does not lead the end of racism  
   - Much like the abolishment of gendered entrance to the workplace leads to non-gendered economic outcomes  
 - Brown v Board of Education  

### Tokenistic Fallacy 
 - The presence of a single person in a position of power is an indication of the end of racism  
 - Though improvements have been made, one can not ignore disparate social outcomes  
 - African Americans have been congress people and millionaires long before the civil rights movement  
 - This does not mean that racism did not exist after that   

### Ahistorical Fallacy  
 - Slavery, sub-human status, nonvoting rights, forceful removal from land has contemporary effects  
 - Both near and far past effect current status  

### Racism is Fixed  
 - The way that racism operates is differnet in place and time  
 - One can not simply ask the question have things gotten better or worse  
 - Have things gotten better or worse?, is legitimate only after we account for the morphing attributes of racism  

## Racial Domination  
 - Two specific types of racial domination, institutional and interpersonal  

### Institutional Racism  
 - White domination of people of color embeded in corporations, universities, leagl systems, political bodies, cultural life, and social collectives  
 - Institutional racism has the symbolic power to classify a normal group and an abnormal group  
 - Political power to withhold rights and uphold segregation  
 - Economic power to advance and accumulate  
 - Inherently related, if we talk about blank poverty we need to talk about white wealth  

### Interpersonal Racism  
 - Informed by institutional racism  
 - Rather than being overt it is often secret even to the performer  
 - Structurlized racism embeds racist attitudes  

## Conflict Between Racially Dominated Groups  
 - Institutional racism is the product of years of white supremacy  
 - There is no such thing as black or institutional reverse racism  
 - There is no normalized system that denies whites full participation in the rights, privelages, and seats of power of our society  
 - People of color can reinforce white dominance  
 - Racial slurs can go in all directions but non-white slurs reinfoorce and have history of power  

## Symbolic Violence  
 - Symbolic violence, violence which is exercised upon a social agent with their complicity  
 - Think white beauty and black ugliness  
 - This is internalized by both white and non-white groups  

## Intersecting Modes of Domination  
 - Racial essentialism means that race plays the highest priority for outcomes  
 - We know this is not true and lends to intersectionality  
 - We need to be careful of how we apply intersectionality as a response to essentialism  
   - Often times its applied as a more detailed essintial structure
   - Ex: If youre black and pooe and gender queer your experience will be X
