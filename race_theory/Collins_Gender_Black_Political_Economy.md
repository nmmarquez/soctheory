# Gender, Black Feminism, and Black Political Economy  

## Intro  
 - Du Bois saw race, class, and nation as social hierarchies  
   - Ones that shaped African Americans access to status, poverty and power  
 - How do nation-state inequalities reinforce social inequalities  
 - Du Bois argues that Black Political economy is niether  
   - Composed of each of these three power dynamics in parallel  
   - Each of these three dynamics is heirarchical  
     - Racism as a subset of captialism  
   - Each is interesected  
 - Du Bois only began to note the importance of gender  
   - Held less weight than race, class and nation  
 - Anna Julia Cooper and Ida Wells Barnett  
   - Studied suffrage of black woman and institutionalized rape  
 - Balck women experience a gendered form of black politcal economy  
 - Focus on Black Women's experience expands understanding of AA experience  
   - Ex: Balck woman in power have a different idea of political then balck men  
 - How does a gendered approach shift our analysis of the Black political Economy?  
   - Inherently different than Du Bois' special burden  
   - An approach that sees black womens experience as centrally different  

## The working Family Nexus and Black Womens Poverty  
 - Family structure and male female positions very differnt from black and white  
 - Balck womens disadvantage lm status effects black family org  
 - A gendered view of income highlights other intersectional interactions  
   - Black women make many purchasing desicions in family life  
   - Due to consumer racism and depressed incomes Black women dont have as much purchasing power  

## The Work/Family Nexus as a site of Intersectionality  
 - Intersectional paradigms reinforce one another  
 - Each social hierarchy relies on the work/family nexus that frames understanding of property  
 - Because they lack current male income and history of proprty single black mothers especially penalized  
 - Sexual hierarchies privelage hetrosexuals by their ability to participate  
 - Regulations concerning inter-racial marriage highlight marriage expectations  
 - They also play into desegragation notions as mixed race nieghboorhoods lead to lower property values  

## Toward a Gendered Analysis of Black Political Economy  
 - Helping balck men does not inherently help black women  
 - Black woman have demonstrated roles of budgeting  
   - Interesting sentiment  
 - In order to improve status of groups intergenerational wealth needs to be addressed  
 - Study of black family and black civil society puts gender second
