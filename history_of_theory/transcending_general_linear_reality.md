# Transcending General Linear Reality  

## Intro  
 - The world is becoming linearified  
 - All the assumptions of the model apply to life now  
 - causality is unilateral  
 - independence!!!!!  

## GLR  
 - A way of thinking about how society works  
 - We map the working of real life onto algebra  
 - The assumptions are in stark contrast with  
   - Traditional social theory  
   - Symbolic interactionism  
 - Assumes cause effect same over time  
 - Assumes effect over same period  

### Example 1: Measuring Dispersion of Income  
 - Economic Variables are inherently linked  
 - Variables are likely autoregressive  
 - 

### Example 2: Marriage and Working Women  
 - variables do not change in tandem  
 - 
 - perils of aggregation removing narrative
